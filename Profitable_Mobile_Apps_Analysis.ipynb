Instead, we will attempt to analyse only a sample of that data. \n",

    "We see the same trend for the other most popular app genres, whereby one or two apps within a particular genre dominate based on the number of user reviews.The review count for the reference genre, for instance, is heavily influenced by the Bible and Dictionary.com apps. Similarly, social networking apps are dominated by Facebook and Pinterest, and music apps by Pandora and Spotify. \n",
    "\n",
    "This makes certain genres of apps seem more popular than they actually are as these dominant apps significantly skew the average review count for each genre. Removing these overwhelmingly popular apps for each genre will make the analysis more accurate and provide us with a better picture of app popularity, but we will not concern ourselves with doing so just yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this pattern, the reference genre does show some promise in terms of the innovations that can be made when developing new reference apps. For example, one thing that can be done is to take a popular book and develop an app version of it where new features can be implemented, aside from the raw text of the physical book. This may include an audio version of the book and daily quotes etc. Furthermore, embedding a dictionary of words within the book app can improve the user experience in terms convenience as users would no longer need to exit the app and refer to an external source.\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea very much fits well with the general theme that the iOS App Store is dominated by apps made for fun. As the market is oversaturated with entertainment-based apps, developing a practical app would benefit our fictional app development business as it will likely stand out amongst the colossal volume of apps avaiable on the App store.\n",

    "As reasonably expected, removing the communication apps that have over 100 million installs significantly reduces the average for this category by over 10 times.\n",

    "This same trend holds true again for several other categories that are dominated by some ubiquitously popular apps. For example, the video players category which is the second most popular has an average of almost 25 million installs, but is dominated by apps such as Youtube, Google Play Movies & TV, and MX Player. Furthermore down the line, we have social apps dominated by the likes of Facebook and Instagram, photography apps by Google Photos and several other photo editors, then productivity apps (MS Word, Dropbox, Google Calender etc.).\n",

Furthermore, these few giants are hard to compete against in their respective categories.\n",

    "Exploring even further, the books and reference category appears to be sufficiently popular also, with an average of 8.7 million installs. We have similarly found that this genre shows potential for the App Store. Because our aim is to recommend an app profile that is profitable for both the App Store and Google Play markets, it is once again worth exploring this genre further. \n",
